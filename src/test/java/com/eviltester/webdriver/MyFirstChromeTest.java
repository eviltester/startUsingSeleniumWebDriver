     You can easily install Chromedriver on windows using chocolatey:

     - https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=ChromeDriver

     If you are on a Mac then you could install ChromeDriver using HomeBrew

     - https://brew.sh/
     - https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/chromedriver#default

~~~~~~~~
brew update
brew cask install chromedriver
~~~~~~~~

And keeping it up to date

~~~~~~~~
brew cask upgrade chromedriver

         if you have not added ChromeDriver to the path then you need to tell Selenium WebDriver where
         the executable of the driver is located. You can do that using code like the following

         The `chromeDriverLocation` string should be the actual physical path of the executable.

         If you installed through Chocolatey or Homebrew then you should not need the following lines as the
         executable will be on your path.

         You can tell if the executable is on your path by typing `chromedriver` into a command prompt and if it is
         a recognised command then it is on your path.
