# Windows Install Speedrun checklist
 
## Install Java Pre-requisites

You need to have Java, Maven and IntelliJ installed.

For instructions on how to install Java, Maven and IntelliJ; and check they are working, use the checklist in `startUsingJavaJunit` project:

* [`startUsingJavaJunit` project](https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingJavaJUnit)
* [Java Install Checklist](https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingJavaJUnit/blob/master/speedrun_install_java_checklist.md)

**Note: I currently recommend using `ChromeDriver` as your default driver and the current version of Chrome as your default browser. If you only setup one driver and browser, make it Chrome, it is a lot easier to start with.**


---

## Install Firefox GeckoDriver or ChromeDriver the 'fast' way on Windows

Both GeckoDriver and ChromeDriver are available to install via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

- ChromeDriver
    - https://chocolatey.org/packages/selenium-chrome-driver
    - `choco install selenium-chrome-driver`
- Firefox GeckoDriver
    - https://chocolatey.org/packages/selenium-gecko-driver
    - `choco install selenium-gecko-driver`

---

## Install Firefox GeckoDriver or ChromeDriver the 'long' way on Windows

Note: You only really have to install one of these to get started. I recommend ChromeDriver and Chrome.

---

###  Install Chrome and ChromeDriver on Windows

* `[ ]`Install Current version of Chrome
* `[ ]`download ChromeDriver add it to the path
    * https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/
* `[ ]`in startUsingSeleniumWebDriver folder run command `mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstChromeTest`
    * If you did everything correctly then Chrome should have started and a test should have run

---

###  Install Firefox and GeckoDriver on Windows

* `[ ]` Install Current version of Firefox
* `[ ]`download GeckoDriver add it to the path
    * https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver
        * https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
    * Unzip the downloaded archive file and add to the windows path
        - `geckodriver.exe`
    * Check that you have added to the path by typing `geckodriver` into a command prompt
* `[ ]`in startUsingSeleniumWebDriver folder run command `mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTest`
    * If you did everything correctly then Firefox should have started and a test should have run

---

## Install Sample WebDriver Project on Windows

* `[ ]`Download Test Project (this has a simple pom.xml and a basic test to run)
    * `[ ]`visit https://github.com/eviltester/startUsingSeleniumWebDriver
    * `[ ]`download the zip file and unzip somewhere

* `[ ]`Install and run IntelliJ Community Edition

* `[ ]`open project for the unzipped pom.xml file

---

* Check the most up to date version of WebDriver
    * `[ ]`check for most up to date version of WebDriver in the unzipped pom.xml file
        * `[ ]`check the webdriver downloads page or the maven page for the up to date version
            - https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
    * `[ ]`amend the pom.xml file if the version number is not up to date
    * `[ ]`exit IntelliJ
    
The version number is contained in this section of the `pom.xml` e.g. this says use version `3.13.0` of Selenium WebDriver

~~~~~~~~
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
            <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
			<version>3.13.0</version>
        </dependency>
~~~~~~~~    

---

##  Run Test From IDE on Windows

* `[ ]`Back in IntelliJ

* `[ ]`run MyFirstTest, or MyFirstTestFF48 or MyFirstChromeTest class
    * `[ ]`right click on the class in the project window and select "Run 

* `[ ]`When the test runs from the IDE, you are finished your install and setup

# Mac Install Speedrun checklist - Homebrew

    * `[ ]`amend the `pom.xml` file if the version number is not up to date
    * `[ ]`exit IntelliJ

---

##  Install SafarDriver on Mac

SafariDriver is built into the Mac operating system.

We need to enable remote execution in Safari Browser to use it.

- `Safari \ Preferences \ Advanced`
   - `[x]` show develop menu in menu bar
- `Develop \ Allow Remote Execution`

---

##  Install Firefox and GeckoDriver on Mac

---

## Install Firefox GeckoDriver or ChromeDriver the 'long' way on Mac

Remember you can skip this step if you used HomeBrew.

### Firefox GeckoDriver the 'long' way on Mac 

* `[ ]`download GeckoDriver add it to the path
   * https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver
   * https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
   * extract into a folder
       * if using version 2.53.1 of WebDriver then rename to wires
       * if using version 3 of WebDriver then leave as geckodriver
   * add path to `.bash_profile`
   * `export PATH=$PATH:/folder/you/extracted/it/to`
   * `[ ]`in startUsingSeleniumWebDriver folder run command `mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstTestFF48`
   
---

      * add folder path to `.bash_profile`
      * `export PATH=$PATH:/folder/you/extracted/it/to`
      * `[ ]`in startUsingSeleniumWebDriver folder run command `mvn test -Dtest=MyFirstChromeTest`

---

##  Run Test From IDE on Windows or Mac

* `[ ]` Back in IntelliJ

* `[ ]` run `MyFirstTest`, or `MyFirstChromeTest` or `MyFirstSafariTest` class depending on which drivers you installed
    * `[ ]`right click on the class in the project window and select "Run 

* `[ ]`When the test runs from the IDE, you are finished your install and setup

> **Note: on mac if you experience an error running ChromeDriver `"chromedriver" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.`** then try the answers here:** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60362018/
> 
> - I use `which chromedriver` to find out where chromedriver is installed
> - `cd /usr/local/Caskroom/chromedriver/` to go to chromedriver install
> - `ls` to find out the version of chromedriver then
> - `cd 83.0.4103.39` where `82.0.4103.39` was the version shown when I typed `ls`
> - then `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver`
